latex-foo
=========

I hate latex. Still got to work with it, so here is a collection of bits which help me ease the pain. Putting it here serves me as a little procrastination.

At some point, I'll procrastinate like crazy and go for [Sphinxtr](http://jterrace.github.com/sphinxtr/singlehtml/index.html). Markdown is just too sexy.

Contents
========
- *title.tex*: Some fancy-looking title page. I used it for internship reports and my diploma (eq. masters) thesis.
- *UseLatex.cmake* and *CMakeLists.txt*: Using cmake for compiling your latex project. Because out-of-source builds rock and it uses imagemagick to deal with image formats. It just feels right to use VS20xx to compile your latex -.-

More will certainly be added the more furstrated I'll grow.
